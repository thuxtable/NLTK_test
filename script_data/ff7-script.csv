This is curative Materia. If you want to know what its effect is, line the cursor up with [Check], and push the OK button. It's just like selecting battle commands. Just line the cursor up to [Magic], you can see that the available magic has increased. Now you can use new magic [Cure]. And that's all there is to equipping Materia. See? It wasn't that tough! When you want to remove any Materia, it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot, and pushing the triangle button. There's just one thing you have to be careful of. Whenever you equip Materia, your situation changes. Parts of you may become stronger... while others get weaker. Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia, your magic power will get stronger. But your physical strength weakens. So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword. On the left side of the screen, you can see the Materia's effect on you. It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia.

And you've got a long battle ahead of you. It pays to save often and take breaks when you need them. Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games. But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any. You'll have to get some at a (real) store. I guess you already have a Memory card. Put the Card firmly into the slot. Put it in either the right or left side. Then when you're ready, access the menu. Select [Save]. Remember you can't just save wherever you want. You can only save at places marked [Save Point]. When you find one, a message will appear. Whenever you reach a [Save Point], you'll want to save your game. Slot 1 is on the left, slot 2 on the right. Choose either one. Next, choose your file and save it. Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files. If you have files from other games on it, there will be less room to save. The screen only shows 3 files at a time so, press the directional buttons to scroll down the list, and you can see the rest. Remember, the more files you have, the longer it will take to load. One last thing. The Memory card is a delicate device. Be careful when handling it. Never remove it while saving or loading. Don't get mad even if you lose. If that happens, just chill out, and let your head, and your console, cool down. That's all. Remember to save often so you don't lose your games.",Cloud,"Now I'll tell you about saving. You know what'll happen if you don't save? That's right. Everything you worked so hard to do will be lost! You never know when there might be a power outage. And you've got a long battle ahead of you. It pays to save often and take breaks when you need them. Anyway you'll need a Memory card to save your games. But, uh, none of the stores around here sell any. You'll have to get some at a (real) store. I guess you already have a Memory card. Put the Card firmly into the slot. Put it in either the right or left side. Then when you're ready, access the menu. Select [Save]. Remember you can't just save wherever you want. You can only save at places marked [Save Point]. When you find one, a message will appear. Whenever you reach a [Save Point], you'll want to save your game. Slot 1 is on the left, slot 2 on the right. Choose either one. Next, choose your file and save it. Each Memory card can hold up to 15 files. If you have files from other games on it, there will be less room to save. The screen only shows 3 files at a time so, press the directional buttons to scroll down the list, and you can see the rest. Remember, the more files you have, the longer it will take to load.
